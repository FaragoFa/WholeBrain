# Alzheimer's Progression simulaiton

Here we simulate the progression of Alzheimer's disease!
Code used to simulate the results in

adapted and refactored by Gustavo Patow, but without delays...

To use this code:
1. Update setup.py with the data loading routines needed for the project
2. Run alzheimer_simulation.py to execute the actual simulation of the protein propagation
3. Plot the results with plot_AD_results.py
